# Pokedéx using Pokémon API
This project represents a simple yet functional web application that utilizes the [`Pokémon API `](https://pokeapi.co/) and Tailwind CSS. Developed as part of the assessment for the KreiosLabs Internship Program, this project aims to demonstrate practical skills in web development and API integration.

The application leverages the Pokémon API to fetch and display information about the first 500 Pokémons. By utilizing Tailwind CSS, the project ensures a responsive user interface.
